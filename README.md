## 🎯 Introduction

In the banking sector, regulatory reporting demands the consolidation of vast and complex datasets to meet stringent compliance standards. At the heart of this process lies **data profiling** — a critical step to ensure data quality, consistency, and alignment with evolving regulatory reporting instructions.

Traditionally, data profiling relies heavily on **manual rule definitions**, tailored to both the underlying data and specific regulatory guidelines. This approach is not only time-consuming but also struggles to keep pace with dynamic compliance landscapes.

Our project — **GenAI Base Data Profiling** — aims to **revolutionize this process** using the power of **Generative AI (LLMs)** and **unsupervised machine learning**. By leveraging open-source tools and cutting-edge AI models, we automate the generation of profiling rules, perform **adaptive risk scoring**, and intelligently suggest **remediation actions** — all based on the context of regulatory instructions.

This innovation sets the stage for **faster, smarter, and more scalable regulatory data compliance** in financial institutions.

## 💡 Inspiration

Manual data profiling in the banking sector is a **time-consuming, error-prone, and resource-intensive** process.  
Regulatory requirements evolve rapidly, and teams are often stuck with:

- 🛠️ **Manually defining profiling rules** for every new dataset  
- 🔍 **Inconsistent validation checks** across teams and departments  
- 🕒 **Hours of effort** spent analyzing data quality and identifying anomalies  
- 📉 **Delayed insights** that hinder decision-making and compliance readiness

We asked ourselves:  
> _What if we could make data profiling faster, smarter, and scalable with AI?_

### 🚀 Enter GenAI + Unsupervised ML

With the power of **Generative AI (LLMs)** and **unsupervised machine learning**, we set out to **transform the way data profiling works** — from manual labor to intelligent automation.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced

Like any innovation sprint, building this end-to-end solution came with a fair share of technical and time-based challenges. Here’s what we tackled:

- 📄 **Rule Extraction from PDFs**  
  Extracting structured rules from regulatory PDF documents proved difficult.  
  ➤ As a workaround, we created a CSV format to represent rules.  
  ➤ Future enhancement: Automate rule extraction directly from documents using LLMs and OCR.

- 🐍 **Backend Setup with Python**  
  Encountered multiple issues with dependency conflicts and package compatibility.  
  ➤ Faced API rate limits and OpenAI key consumption problems during development.

- 🧑‍💻 **UI Development Under Time Pressure**  
  Integrating core features into the frontend within tight deadlines was a significant challenge.  
  ➤ Ensuring usability and real-time interaction required multiple iterations.

- 📊 **KPI Generation**  
  Current KPI generation is semi-automated.  
  ➤ Future improvement: Build a fully automated, real-time KPI generation engine tied to profiling logic.

Despite these challenges, we delivered a functional MVP that lays the groundwork for a production-grade solution.
