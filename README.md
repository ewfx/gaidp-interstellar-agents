## 💡 Inspiration
Manual rule extraction and validation are time-consuming and error-prone. We wanted to leverage GenAI to create an intelligent, automated data profiling system that enhances accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.



🛠️ How We Built It

LLM Integration: OpenAI models

Data Storage: In-memory rules, file-based historical storage (moving towards DB)

Frontend: Interactive UI for rule training, updates, and transaction analysis

## ⚙️ What It Does
Automates Rule Extraction – Moves from CSV-based manual rules to LLM-driven refinement

Refines Data Validation – Uses OpenAI models & Python to enhance rule precision

Interactive Compliance Portal – Provides a UI for transaction analysis & compliance checks

Anomaly Detection – Detects inconsistencies using historical data and logical validation

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Backend: Python

LLM Integration: OpenAI models O1

Data Storage: In-memory rules, file-based historical storage (moving towards DB)

Frontend: Steamlit, Interactive UI for rule training, updates, and transaction analysis
